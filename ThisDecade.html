    In 2011 many high quality games were released such as portal 2, uncharted 3, Batman: Arkham City , dark souls and L.A. Noire. However the best game of 2011 was most definitely Skyrim : The Elder Scrolls V. A game which in the following years was ported to nearly every console and is still being supported today. The reason for is long life span is due to its healthy mod support of thousands of mods readily available.

But the games that should the world that you didn't need an open-world or pointless content was The Last of Us. The only downside to this title was its exclusivity to the PlayStation platform.

                            <p>This year the 8th generation consoles took off and along with it an impressive jump in hardware and graphical fidelity. Some of the gorgeous games that came out that year were Shadow of Mordor, Destiny, Wolfenstein, Watch Dogs and the Evil within. However the most anticipated game that year must have been Kojimas Metal Gear Solid 5</p>
                            <p>The game had a rocky development and kojima left the company however he made sure that fans would still love the game. The story is rushed towards the end however the gameplay comes first in this game. The tools and gadgets that the player is granted makes messing around in the open world extremly fun. From balloons that can lift people and objects to rocket arms that can be controlled mid flight, the gameplay is truly revolutionary.</p>

                       Games are not perfect but if a game was as close to perfection that was feasibly possiable then that game would be The Witcher 3. The setting, athmosphere , music , gameplay , dlc and basically everything about this game is as close to perfection as it can be. There is not much else to say apart from go out and get it.

However the most recomended game of this year has to be the remaster of a ps2 classic,  Yakuza Kiwami. This game isn't as well known in the western world and is only in japanese with english subtitles, however the world and interactions as well as the classic story all all top tier. You can wonder around for hours and spend time playing pointless by fun minigames. </p>
                            <p>The Story starts as a member of the notorious tojo clan is framed for murder in order to save his best friend, and released from prison 10 years later only to find his the tojo clan in disarray and a young girl on the run.</p>

                        It was during this year that many people took notice of the egregious microtransactions in games that were ruining the industry. This was primeraly the fault of StarWars Battlefront 2 which caused the govement to get involved. However the best game of that year was a single player game with no microtransactions in sight, that being The Legend Of Zelda Breath Of The Wild.

                    </p>
                    <p>This game is perfect for new comers to gaming and for hardcore gamers. It is welcoming for beginers as button prompts show up on screen and the basic loop is simple however for the more experinced gamers there are sophisticated mechanics that allow for all types of gameplay. This is a master piece of a game that alot of thought and effort has gone into making it user friendly and fun to play.</p>
                    <p>No matter where you go there is always something to do and it is usually helpful. If there is one game to try from this website it's this one. The only downside is that it requires a nintendo console</p>

                    <p>The quality of games that came out this year was astounding. God of War, SpiderMan, Monster Hunter World, Assasins creed Odyssey Forza Horizon 4 and Far Cry 5 were some of the most beautiful and well crafted games this year each that could have been the game of the year. Unfortunatly they happend to released the same year as Rockstars Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
                    <p>This game that was worked on for over 8 years is a master piece of visuals and elevates the perceptions of consoles being inferior to pc. A prequel to the first Red Dead Redempton this game is about Auther Morgans story as he lives among side his fellow gang memebers and does as cowboys do.</p>

                        The year that has just ended. Through out this year there were many games that terrible but also many that were excellent. Some of the better games were Sekiro, Resident Evil 2 , Death Stranding, Days gone and Devil May Cry 5 however the most immersive game this year was Metro Exodus.

                    </p>
                    <p>The game takes place in Russia after a nuke hits it and people are forced to live underground as terrifying creatures roam the surface. This game is insanely detailed down to manualy wiping dirt of your mask and guns but the real winner here is the graphics. They look absolutely incredible. The true way to play this game is using RayTracing as it makes the tunnels pitch black insted of lit up without it. The lighting effects in this game with Ray Tracing is on a completely other level compared to other games.</p>
                 
                    <p>The only issue with this game is that in order to be fully immersed it requires a pretty high end pc but it can be played on consoles or lower end hardware too</p>
