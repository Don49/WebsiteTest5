        <h2>CyperPunk 2077</h2>
        <p>The most anticipated release this year is CyberPunk 2077 releasing in april by CD Project Red. The game was announced in 2012 and fans have been eagerly awaiting the next RPG from the studio that created The Witcher 3, an game that set the standered of what an RPG should be. Now 8 years later and after alot of hype building up from the PR team at CD Project Red, fans can't wait to sink their teeths in to this title.</p>
        <p>The freedom that comes along with the game, the futuristic yet grounded in reality setting and the signature narrative by CD Project Red has all combined over 8 years of passion into a game that may hold the title of game of the Decade</p>

        <p>The premise of CyberPunk 2077 is that you play as a mercenary in night city and after a chip is inserted into your charactor the ghost of Johnny Silverhand appears and sets of events in night city.

        <h2>Dying light 2</h2>
        <p>The follow up to the massively popular Dying Light. Taking place 15 years after a virus broke out across the globe that rendered most of the population in to mindless zombies. The only thing they crave is living flesh.</p>
        <p>This title is dearly loved by its community as the previous game released in 2015 is still receiving free <abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> today, 4 years later.</p>
        <img class="CenterImage" src="Images/DyingLight2.jfif" alt="Dying Light 2" />
        <p>A first person zombie game with parkour elements and a heavy emphasis on melee weapons along with being able to complete the whole game in coop makes this the ideal game for any hardcore or casual gamer.</p>
        <p>Desicions that change the outcome of the story as well as the world and guaranteed mod suport on the pc make the replayability of this game very high.</p>

    <div class="centerDiv">
        <h2>The Last of Us: Part 2</h2>
        <p>2013 saw the release of The Last Of Us on the ps4 and now the sequel will be released. The story continues afew years after the ending of the first game with playable character Ellie leading this time round. Not Much is none about the story at the present moment however we aready know what level of storytelling to excpect coming from the last game.</p>
        <p>The only downside to this title is that it will be only available on the PS4. Those on xbox, switch or pc won't be able to experince this title first hand.</p>
        <img class="CenterImage" src="Images/TheLast2.jfif" alt="The Last Of Us 2" />
       
        <p>The setting is a post-apocalyptic world after a pathogen infects most of the populus. The gameplay will most likely be a heavily linear experience with excellent story and set pieces while still placing and emphasis on survival.</p>
